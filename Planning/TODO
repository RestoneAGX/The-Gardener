> Slash based on rotation (get the slope of the player to mouse, then convert that to an angle then convert that to a x and y, to which we multiply by a constant to get a limited rotation)
> Work on collision
> Time system
> Work on a death State and respawning

Testing TODO:
> Write and test ECS system

Multiplayer Draft:
- Have a menu to ask for single player or multiplayer
- If Multiplayer is selected
- > fork the process
- > exec the server application that this comes with
- > Open up a thread for [a server pipe, wait to kill the server]
